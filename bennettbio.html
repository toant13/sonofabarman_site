        	<h1>BENNETT LASSETER</h1>
         
			<p>
	Bennett was a young boy, growing up in the country town of Sonoma, California. He had a love for cartoons and movies, and could often be found glued to the TV, building Legos, or making up games with his four brothers. He had an interest in creative writing, but after taking a film class in high school things just clicked. Bennett earned his BA in film production at Loyola Marymount University School of Film and Television. During his time at LMU, he explored lighting and grip work, experimented in the editing lab, interned at Disneynature in Paris and settled into directing after making a short documentary in Italy for his junior thesis and a western short film his senior year. After his time at LMU, he worked as a freelance editor, while moonlighting as a skipper on the World Famous Jungle Cruise in Disneyland. He is currently earning his MFA as a directing fellow at the American Film Institute, and continues to draw inspiration from cartoons, his hometown and his family.
